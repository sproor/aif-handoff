# Configuration

All configuration is done via environment variables. Copy `.env.example` to `.env`:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Node packages (`@aif/api`, `@aif/agent`, `@aif/data`, `@aif/shared`) auto-load env from monorepo root at startup:

- `.env`
- `.env.local` (loaded after `.env`, overrides duplicate keys)

## Environment Variables

Environment validation is handled by Zod in `packages/shared/src/env.ts`. The application will fail to start with a descriptive error if required variables are invalid.

## Authentication

The Agent SDK supports two authentication methods:

1. **Default (recommended):** Uses your active Claude subscription credentials from `~/.claude/`. No configuration needed.
2. **API Key:** Set `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` in `.env` to use a dedicated key.

### Runtime Readiness Check

API exposes `GET /agent/readiness` to verify auth state at runtime:

- `ready=true`: agent can run AI stages.
- `ready=false`: neither `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` nor Claude profile auth was detected.
- The web app shows a warning banner when `ready=false`.

## Database

The database is a single SQLite file. The default path `./data/aif.sqlite` is relative to the project root.

Runtime DB access is centralized in `@aif/data`. `@aif/api` and `@aif/agent` are lint-restricted from importing DB helpers and SQL builders directly.

To use a different location:

```
DATABASE_URL=/absolute/path/to/database.sqlite
```

Initialize the schema with:

```bash
npm run db:setup
```

## Logging

Pino structured JSON logging is used throughout. Set `LOG_LEVEL` to control verbosity:

| Level   | Use Case                                                          |
| ------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `trace` | Very verbose, includes all internal details                       |
| `debug` | Development default — shows DB queries, WS events, agent activity |
| `info`  | Production — key events only                                      |
| `warn`  | Warnings and deprecations                                         |
| `error` | Errors only                                                       |
| `fatal` | Application crashes                                               |

Each package creates a named logger:

```typescript
import { logger } from "@aif/shared";
const log = logger("my-module");
log.info({ key: "value" }, "Something happened");
```

Agent query audit logs are controlled by `AGENT_QUERY_AUDIT_ENABLED`. When enabled, query payloads are written to `logs/{agentName}.log` with rotation.

### Activity Logging

Activity logging tracks tool events during agent runs. Two modes are available:

- **`sync`** (default): Each tool event is written to the database immediately via `select+update`. Safe and simple but generates one DB write per event.
- **`batch`**: Tool events are buffered in memory and flushed in batches. Reduces DB write amplification at the cost of slight delay in log visibility. Flush triggers: batch size limit (`ACTIVITY_LOG_BATCH_SIZE`), max age timer (`ACTIVITY_LOG_BATCH_MAX_AGE_MS`), and explicit flush on stage boundaries/shutdown.

The queue is bounded by `ACTIVITY_LOG_QUEUE_LIMIT` to prevent unbounded memory growth — when the limit is reached, the oldest entries are dropped and a warning is logged.

## Agent Polling

The coordinator checks for actionable tasks every `POLL_INTERVAL_MS` milliseconds (default: 30 seconds). Lower values mean faster task processing but more CPU usage.

For development, 30 seconds is a good default. In production, adjust based on your workload.

### Query Startup Timeout

Subagent query startup has a dedicated guard:

- If no first stream message arrives within `AGENT_QUERY_START_TIMEOUT_MS`, the run is marked as `query_start_timeout`.
- The coordinator performs one automatic retry after `AGENT_QUERY_START_RETRY_DELAY_MS`.
- If the second attempt also times out, normal error handling applies (stage failure path).

### Stale Task Watchdog

The coordinator includes a stale-stage watchdog:

- Tracks task liveness via `lastHeartbeatAt` (falls back to `updatedAt` for older rows).
- Effective stale baseline uses the freshest of `lastHeartbeatAt` and `updatedAt`.
- If a task is stale in `planning`, `implementing`, or `review` for longer than `AGENT_STAGE_STALE_TIMEOUT_MS`, it is auto-moved to `blocked_external` with backoff.
- If stale recovery count reaches `AGENT_STAGE_STALE_MAX_RETRY`, the task stays in `blocked_external` without `retryAfter` (manual intervention required).
- For stale `implementing` tasks, recovery resumes from `plan_ready` to avoid half-broken implementation continuation.
- Any valid human/stage transition resets stale-retry debt (`retryCount=0`) and refreshes heartbeat baseline.

## Agent Permissions

Subagents (planner, implementer, reviewer) run shell commands during task execution. By default, permission mode is `acceptEdits` — file edits are auto-approved, but Bash commands like `npm install` require explicit allow rules.

Two approaches:

### Option 1: Bypass all permissions (simple)

Set `AGENT_BYPASS_PERMISSIONS=true` in `.env`. All tool calls are auto-approved without prompting. Convenient for trusted environments and local development.

```
AGENT_BYPASS_PERMISSIONS=true
```

### Option 2: Configure allow rules (granular)

Leave `AGENT_BYPASS_PERMISSIONS=false` (default) and add needed commands to `.claude/settings.json` or `.claude/settings.local.json`:

```json
{
  "permissions": {
    "allow": [
      "Bash(npm install:*)",
      "Bash(npm run:*)",
      "Bash(npm test:*)",
      "Bash(npx:*)",
      "Bash(git:*)"
    ]
  }
}
```

Unlisted commands will be denied in headless agent mode. See [Claude Code permissions docs](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/permissions) for the full rule syntax.

## Agent Budgets

Agent budgets are configured per project (API or Project edit dialog):

- `plannerMaxBudgetUsd`
- `planCheckerMaxBudgetUsd`
- `implementerMaxBudgetUsd`
- `reviewSidecarMaxBudgetUsd` (applies to each review/security sidecar)

If any of these values are not set, that agent runs without SDK budget limit.
